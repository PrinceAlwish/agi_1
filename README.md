# Are you out there wondering where we are going as a generation?

Have you ever thought about robotics and life?  
Where are we going? Again, where will you be?

As a futurist and a tech nerd, I bring you this piece of work that you may reflect on with me.  
Can we make the world a better place? What is the place of tech in all this?  
The tech world is growing and glowing with all new tech and talks, the phrase *“cobots”* is growing among the tech nerds, and one thing I keep asking myself is: *Am I also in it?*

DeepMind has it figured out—a paper on AGI, and it’s just the start.  
Feel free to nerd around this mind map that my good friend has nailed—*NotebookLM*.

Glean through it, perhaps it is just the start of it all?
